Simple Statistics of G1_Graph and G2_Graph::
--------------------------------------------

A. G1_Graph:

The total number of pages in the graph are : 1000
The total number of pages in the graph with no out-links (sinks) are : 63
The total number of pages in the graph with no in-links (sources) are : 0

Proportion of pages with no out-links (sinks) = (number of sink pages in the graph) / (total number of pages in the graph)
											  = 63 / 1000 = 0.063
											  
Proportion of pages with no in-links (sources) = (number of source pages in the graph) / (total number of pages in the graph)
											  = 0 / 1000 = 0
											  
A. G2_Graph:

The total number of pages in the graph are : 
The total number of pages in the graph with no out-links (sinks) are : 6
The total number of pages in the graph with no in-links (sources) are : 0

Proportion of pages with no out-links (sinks) = (number of sink pages in the graph) / (total number of pages in the graph)
											  =  6 / 1000 = 0.006
											  
Proportion of pages with no in-links (sources) = (number of source pages in the graph) / (total number of pages in the graph)
											   = 0 / 1000 = 0
